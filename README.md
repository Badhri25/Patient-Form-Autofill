# Patient Form Autofill System - Stux Technologies Take-Home Project

## Overview

This application allows healthcare staff to enter patient information once and automatically fill it into various PDF forms, demonstrating that the same patient data can be applied correctly regardless of which form is used and regardless of who the patient is.

## Features

- **Universal Patient Data Entry**: Input patient information (name, height, weight, birthday) once and apply to multiple forms
- **Intelligent Field Mapping**: Automatically maps patient data to form fields using fuzzy matching, even when field names vary between forms
- **Multiple Form Support**: Works with both uploaded PDF forms and built-in sample forms
- **Real-time Validation**: Provides immediate feedback on data entry with visual validation indicators
- **Offline Processing**: All processing happens client-side with no server or internet connection required
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works in all modern web browsers

## Quick Start

1. **Open the Application**
   ```
   Open index.html in any modern web browser
   ```
   No installation, build process, or server setup required.

2. **Enter Patient Data**
   - Fill in patient information: First Name, Last Name, Height (feet/inches), Weight (pounds)
   - Optionally add birthday for additional calculated fields (age, BMI)

3. **Select a Form**
   - Choose from built-in sample forms (recommended for testing)
   - Or upload your own fillable PDF form

4. **Process and Download**
   - Click "Fill Form & Download PDF"
   - The filled form will automatically download

## Test Data

The application includes quick-fill buttons for testing:

- **Steve Testing**: 5'10", 180 lb, DOB: 8/9/2000
- **Joe Doe**: 6'0", 210 lb, DOB: 8/9/1990  
- **Jane Smith**: 5'6", 140 lb, DOB: 3/15/1985
- **Random Patient**: Generates random test data

## Field Mapping Strategy

The system uses intelligent field mapping that recognizes various naming conventions:

- **First Name**: `first_name`, `firstname`, `fname`, `given_name`, `patient_first`
- **Last Name**: `last_name`, `lastname`, `surname`, `family_name`, `patient_last`
- **Height**: `height`, `ht`, `stature`, `height_ft_in`, `height_feet_inches`
- **Weight**: `weight`, `wt`, `mass`, `body_weight`, `patient_weight`
- **Birthday**: `birthday`, `birth_date`, `dob`, `date_of_birth`, `patient_dob`

The system also calculates and fills additional fields when possible:
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Age (calculated from birthday)
- Height in centimeters
- Weight in kilograms

## Browser Requirements

- Chrome/Edge 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Modern mobile browsers with JavaScript enabled

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+)
- **PDF Processing**: PDF-lib library (loaded from CDN)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern design patterns
- **Architecture**: Single-page application with modular JavaScript classes
- **Storage**: In-memory only (no data persistence or transmission)

## File Structure

```
project-folder/
├── index.html              # Complete standalone application
├── sample-forms/           # Provided PDF forms for testing
│   ├── health-exam-form.pdf
│   └── wicform.pdf
└── README.md              # This file
```

## Known Limitations

### Static PDF Forms Issue

The provided PDF forms (health-exam-form.pdf and wicform.pdf) are **static documents without fillable form fields**. These are essentially scanned or printed forms that cannot be programmatically filled by any automated system.

**Technical Details:**
- Static PDFs contain only text and images, not interactive form elements
- Fillable PDFs require specific form field objects (text fields, checkboxes, dropdowns)
- The system correctly identifies when PDFs have no form fields (displays "Total form fields found: 0")

**Workarounds:**
- Use the built-in sample forms which are properly configured with form fields
- Convert static PDFs to fillable forms using Adobe Acrobat or similar tools
- Use PDF overlay techniques (not implemented in this version)

### Other Limitations

- **PDF Size Limit**: 10MB maximum file size for uploaded forms
- **Form Field Types**: Supports text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons
- **Browser Compatibility**: Requires modern browser with full JavaScript support
- **Field Name Matching**: Relies on field names containing recognizable patterns

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Console Output
The application provides detailed console logging. Open browser Developer Tools (F12) to see:
- PDF analysis results
- Field mapping details  
- Form filling progress
- Error messages and warnings

### Common Issues

1. **"No form fields found"**
   - The PDF is static and has no fillable fields
   - Solution: Use sample forms or convert PDF to fillable format

2. **"No matching form fields found"**
   - PDF has fields but names don't match expected patterns
   - Check console for actual field names and update mapping patterns if needed

3. **"Fields not filled in downloaded PDF"**
   - Usually indicates static PDF or field mapping issues
   - Check console output for detailed error messages

### Debug Mode
Click on any uploaded PDF to see the debug panel showing:
- Total form fields detected
- Field types and names
- Mapping confidence score
- Detailed field-by-field analysis

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl/Cmd + Enter**: Process form
- **Ctrl/Cmd + 1-4**: Quick fill patients (Steve, Joe, Jane, Random)

## Security and Privacy

- **No Data Transmission**: All processing happens locally in the browser
- **No Data Storage**: Patient information is not saved or stored anywhere
- **HIPAA Considerations**: Offline processing eliminates data breach risks
- **No External Dependencies**: Only uses CDN for PDF-lib library

## Development Notes

The application demonstrates several key technical concepts:

1. **Client-side PDF Processing**: Using PDF-lib to analyze and modify PDF documents entirely in the browser
2. **Intelligent Field Mapping**: Fuzzy matching algorithms to handle varying field naming conventions
3. **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with visual feedback
4. **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for a production version:

- OCR integration for truly static forms
- Machine learning for improved field mapping
- Integration with EMR systems
- Batch processing capabilities
- Custom field mapping configuration
- Multi-language support

## Support

For technical issues:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify PDF has fillable form fields
3. Test with provided sample forms to confirm system functionality
4. Ensure browser meets minimum requirements
